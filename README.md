# title_generation

The aim of the project was to generate title of research papers from their abstract. I have used NIPS and ARXIV dataset available in Kaggle. The model gives a result of **13.08%** on *ROGUE-1* metric. 

**NIPS Dataset** - https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers

**ARXIV Dataset** - https://www.kaggle.com/neelshah18/arxivdataset
